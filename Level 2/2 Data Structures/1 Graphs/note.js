  "So the basic implementation is that \
if we see carefully the answer can be obtained by REVERSING THE ARROW OR (1 + DFS OF NEXT NODE IF WE ASSUME IT TO BE UNDIRECTED GRAPH, what i mean is that hum log 2 map ma graph banaiga ek ma directed items ko rekha ga (as per given in the question) and ek apan yeh assume karka banainga ki wo undirected graph ha, \
\
So hum traverse karna suru karanga from source node (1) aur uska saare undirected graph ki traverse karanga, agar humko directed map ma node milti ha to\
              minReverse = getMinReverseEdges() function \
              aur nahi milta ha to\
              minReverse = 1 + getMinReverseEdges() function \
we also have to handle some conditions such as ";
